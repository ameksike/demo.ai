Model Context Protocol (MCP) solves this by introducing a universal standard for connecting AI to data. Instead of patchwork solutions, it provides a streamlined, open protocol that simplifies integrations, breaks down silos, and unlocks the full potential of AI to deliver relevant, high-quality results.

### What is MCP and Why Does It Matter?

MCP is an open standard by Anthropic, designed to provide a universal way to connect data sources with AI-powered tools. Whether it’s your content repositories, business tools, or developer environments, MCP simplifies the process of building secure, two-way connections so AI can finally work the way it’s supposed to.

With MCP, developers no longer have to reinvent the wheel for every data source. Instead, they can focus on creating smarter, more connected AI systems that scale without the constant drag of maintaining fragmented integrations.

### How MCP Works

MCP works by bridging two key components: MCP servers that expose data sources and MCP clients (AI apps) that connect to those servers. This architecture is simple but incredibly flexible, allowing AI systems to easily access the data they need in real time, while providing a permissions framework to control access.

- Hosts are LLM applications (like Claude Desktop or IDEs) that initiate connections
- Clients maintain 1:1 connections with servers, inside the host application
- Servers provide context, tools, and prompts to clients
