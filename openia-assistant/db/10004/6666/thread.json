I'll help you if you have a math problem though.\n\nHowever, I notice that the functions provided seem to be general-purpose and don't directly relate to mathematical operations. If you'd like, we can work with some hypothetical functions or use existing ones to solve a mathematical problem. Which one would you prefer?\n\nIf you provide me with the correct function names (like \"math_function1\" instead of \"weather_get\") and the proper parameters for your question, I'll be happy to assist you in solving a math-related issue.",
