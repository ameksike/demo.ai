                <p>Legacy Auth refers to a group of endpoints that facilitate authentication in a manner similar to
                        OAuth, albeit with an older implementation that does not fully comply with the standard. This
                        codebase has been in use for a long time and has been widely adopted across MyCom applications.
                        For more information regarding this topic, consult <a href="{{url.page}}/Legacy.md">this link</a>.

                <h3 id="step1"><a href="{{url.page}}/Legacy.md">SAML login</a> </h3>

                <p>MyCom's implementation of a login flow (SAML, Authorization Code, etc) in the Auth Server consists of
                        three main processes or steps: Information, Identification and Authorization.</p>

                        selected domain, like: login, logout, get permissions, get metadata and profile data. The
                        selection of the domain could be based on the domain name. &nbsp;Example, for "<em>man.steve@<a

                                        rel="nofollow">thy.com</a></em>, knowing that the email format is composed by
                        username, @ and the domain name.</p>

                                style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">parameters are:</span></p>
                <ul>
                        <li><strong>response_type:</strong> REQUIRED. The value must be one of "code" for requesting an
                                authorization code flow, like a token for requesting an access token (implicit grant).
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>client_id: </strong>REQUIRED. The authorization server issues the registered client
                                a client identifier, a unique string representing the registration information provided
                                by the client. The client identifier is not a secret; it is exposed to the resource
                                owner and MUST NOT be used alone for client authentication. The client identifier is
                                unique to the authorization server.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"><strong>scope:</strong> OPTIONAL. The authorization and
                                        token endpoints allow the client to specify the scope of the access request
                                        using the "scope" request parameter. &nbsp;In turn, the authorization server
                                        uses the "scope" response parameter to inform the client of the scope of the
                                        access token issued. The value of the scope parameter is expressed as a list of
                                        space-delimited, case-sensitive strings. The authorization server defines the
                                        strings. If the value contains multiple space-delimited/coma strings, their
                                        order does not matter, and each string adds an additional access range to the
                                        requested scope. If the client omits the scope parameter when requesting
                                        authorization, the authorization server MUST either process the request using a
                                        pre-defined default value or fail the request indicating an invalid scope. The

                        <li><strong>state:</strong> REQUIRED. An opaque value used by the client to maintain state
                                between the request and callback. The authorization server includes this value when
                                redirecting the user-agent back to the client. The parameter SHOULD be used for
                                preventing cross-site request forgery. The state is usually composed by “<em>&lt;Domain
                                        ID&gt; &lt;Product ID&gt;</em>”</li>
                        <li><strong>redirect_uri:</strong> After completing its interaction with the resource owner, the
                                authorization server directs the resource owner's user-agent back to the client. The
                                authorization server redirects the user-agent to the client's redirection endpoint
                                previously established with the authorization server during the client registration
                                process or when making the authorization request. The redirection endpoint URI MUST be
                                an absolute URI and may include an "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" formatted query
                                component [RFC3986] which MUST be retained when adding additional query parameters.</li>
                        <li><strong>code_challenge: &nbsp;</strong>REQUIRED only by OAUTH_PKCE<strong>.</strong> A
                                challenge derived from the code verifier that is sent in the authorization request, to
                                be verified against later. The client uses the output of a suitable random number
                                generator to create a 32-octet sequence. Encoding this octet sequence as base64url
                                provides the value of the <em>code_challenge</em>. If the server requires Proof Key for
                                Code Exchange (PKCE) by OAuth public clients and the client does not send the
                                "<em>code_challenge</em>" in the request, the authorization endpoint must return the
                                authorization error response with the "<em>error</em>" value set to
                                "<em>invalid_request</em>".</li>
                        <li><strong>code_challenge_method:</strong> OPTIONAL. It is a method that was used to derive
                                code challenge. defaults to "<em>plain</em>" if not present in the request. Code
                                verifier transformation method is "<em>S256</em>" or "<em>plain</em>".</li>

                <p>In case of the application does not have any redirect_uri in their backend, the Auth server provides
                        an empty URL that make possible to receive in the Webview component the response from the IDP as
                        following: </p>

                </code-view>
                <p>Note in the response there are two important values: </p>
                <ul>
                        <li><strong>code: </strong>The authorization code generated by the authorization server.
                                &nbsp;The authorization code MUST expire shortly after it is issued to mitigate the risk
                                of leaks. &nbsp;A maximum authorization code lifetime of 10 minutes is RECOMMENDED. The
                                client MUST NOT use the authorization code more than once. If an authorization code is
                                used more than once, the authorization server MUST deny the request and SHOULD revoke
                                (when possible) all tokens previously issued based on that authorization code. &nbsp;The
                                authorization code is bound to the client identifier and redirection URI.</li>
                        <li><strong>email:</strong> The user email how has already logged into to the IDP.</li>

                <p>This is the last step in order to get the access. The authorization endpoint is used to interact with
                        the resource owner and obtain an authorization grant. The authorization server must first verify
                        the identity of the resource owner. The way in which the authorization server authenticates the
                        resource owner (e.g., username and password login, session cookies) is beyond the scope of this
                        specification.</p>

                <p> The required parameters are: </p>
                <ul>
                        <li><strong>client_id:</strong> REQUIRED. The same as described in the above step. The
                                authorization server issues the registered client a client identifier, a unique string
                                representing the registration information provided by the client. The client identifier
                                is not a secret; it is exposed to the resource owner and MUST NOT be used alone for
                                client authentication. The client identifier is unique to the authorization
                                server.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li><strong>client_secret:</strong> REQUIRED. The application’s client secret. This ensures that
                                the request to get the access token is made only from the application, and not from a
                                potential attacker that may have intercepted the authorization code.</li>
                        <li><strong>grant_type:</strong> It must be <em>authorization_code</em><strong>. </strong>This
                                tells the token endpoint that the application is using the Authorization Code grant
                                type.</li>
                        <li><strong>code: </strong>The result of the above step. The authorization code generated by the
                                authorization server. &nbsp;The authorization code MUST expire shortly after it is
                                issued to mitigate the risk of leaks. &nbsp;A maximum authorization code lifetime of 10
                                minutes is RECOMMENDED. The client MUST NOT use the authorization code more than once.
                                If an authorization code is used more than once, the authorization server MUST deny the
                                request and SHOULD revoke (when possible) all tokens previously issued based on that
                                authorization code. &nbsp;The authorization code is bound to the client identifier and
                                redirection URI.</li>
                        <li><strong>redirect_uri:</strong> The same as described in the above
                                step.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>After completing its interaction with the resource owner,
                                the authorization server directs the resource owner's user-agent back to the client. The
                                authorization server redirects the user-agent to the client's redirection endpoint
                                previously established with the authorization server during the client registration
                                process or when making the authorization request. The redirection endpoint URI MUST be
                                an absolute URI and may include an "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" formatted query
                                component [RFC3986] which MUST be retained when adding additional query parameters.</li>
                        <li><strong>code_verifier:</strong> A cryptographically random string that is used to correlate
                                the authorization request to the token request.</li>

                        }</code-view>
                <p>Note in the response there are different values: </p>
                <ul>
                        <li><strong>access_token:</strong> Access token credentials (as well as any confidential access
                                token attributes) MUST be kept confidential in transit and storage, and only shared
                                among the authorization server, the resource servers the access token is valid for, and
                                the client to whom the access token is issued. Access token credentials MUST only be
                                transmitted using TLS.</li>
                        <li><strong>refresh_token:</strong> Refresh tokens MUST be kept confidential in transit and
                                storage, and shared only among the authorization server and the client to whom the
                                refresh tokens were issued. &nbsp;The authorization server MUST maintain the binding
                                between a refresh token and the client to whom it was issued.</li>
                        <li><strong>token_type:</strong> It is usually Bearer. The access token type provides the client
                                with the information required to successfully utilize the access token to make a
                                protected resource request (along with type-specific attributes). &nbsp;The client MUST
                                NOT use an access token if it does not understand the token type. For example, the
                                "bearer" token type defined in RFC 6750, it is utilized by simply including the access
                                token string in the request.</li>
                        <li><strong>expires_in:</strong> The lifetime in seconds of the access token. &nbsp;For example,
                                the value "3600" denotes that the access token will expire in one hour from the time the
                                response was generated. If omitted, the authorization server SHOULD provide the
                                expiration time via other means or document the default value.</li>
                        <li><strong>scope:</strong> The same as described in the above step.<span> The authorization and
                                        token endpoints allow the client to specify the scope of the access request
                                        using the "scope" request parameter. &nbsp;In turn, the authorization server
                                        uses the "scope" response parameter to inform the client of the scope of the
                                        access token issued. The value of the scope parameter is expressed as a list of
                                        space-delimited, case-sensitive strings. The authorization server defines the
                                        strings. If the value contains multiple space-delimited strings, their order
                                        does not matter, and each string adds an additional access range to the
                                        requested scope. If the client omits the scope parameter when requesting
                                        authorization, the authorization server MUST either process the request using a
                                        pre-defined default value or fail the request indicating an invalid scope. The
                                        authorization server SHOULD document its scope requirements and default value
                                        (if defined).</span>&nbsp;</li>
