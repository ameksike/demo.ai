                        <p>If an application type credential is not used or the selected domain does not require SP
                                verification, it is possible to use the authorization variable to specify the access
                                token that you want to invalidate, forcing the end user to logout. In other cases, it
                                will be necessary to use the authorization property to send the client_id and
                                client_secret in basic encoding format, as well as the access_token or refresh_token
                                into the token in the token property. </p>
                        <code-view>https://auth-dev.qa.ewas.aero/v1/oauth/revoke?authorization=ACCESS_TOKEN </code-view>
                        <p class="auto-cursor-target">It should be an HTTP GET action, like the example below.</p>
                        <code-view>https://auth-dev.qa.ewas.aero/v1/oauth/revoke?authorization=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoxODc3MTgsImNyZWRlbnRpYWxJZCI6NDMsImRvbWFpbklkIjo3LCJkZXZpY2UiOiJlYjM1MGNjNTg5ZDU4Y2I1YWRhODhlYWRmYjM4ZmFkZiIsIm1haWwiOiJ1c2VyMUBleGFtcGxlLmNvbSIsImNyZWRlbnRpYWxUeXBlIjoxLCJpYXQiOjE2ODkwNzg4MzMsImV4cCI6MTY4OTUxMDgzM30.BHcUbHsJML8m1xyRh6-zed7zT9W8rYwvRq-VUoc5jK8</code-view>
                        <p>Also, the ACCESS_TOKEN should be set on the authorization header property instead of a GET
                                variable.
                        </p>
                        <p>The login process ends with a redirect to the URL defined in the credential property called
                                redirect URL. Such as the example below:</p>
                        <code-view>https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback?state=logout&email=user1@example.com</code-view>
                        <p>Note in the example above that the redirect URL will receive two parameters: status and
                                email.</p>
                        <p>In case of the application does not have any redirect_uri in their backend, the Auth server
                                provides an empty URL that make possible to receive in the Webview component the
                                response from the IDP as following:</p>
                        <code-view>https://auth-dev.qa.ewas.aero/v1/oauth/token?state=logout&email=user1@example.com</code-view>

                        <p>If you want to <strong> revoke the refresh token</strong>, you must specify the value of the
                                <em>token_type_hint</em> with the value <em>"refresh_token"</em>, if not specified it
                                adopts the
                                value <em>"access_token"</em>.

                        <p>The refresh token revocation flow behaves the same as that of the access token and
                                automatically
                                invalidates the access token as well.</p>

                                        <p>As you can see in the previous example, it is specified explicitly, but it is
                                                not necessary because this is the value that is taken by default if the
                                                <strong><em>response_type</em></strong> property is not specified. As a

                        <p>Keep in mind that in SAML-based integrations, the user is sometimes required to access a
                                screen from the external IDP to complete the logout process, very similar to
                                how login works. This is not mandatory because the AS would be in charge of closing the
                                transfer in the event that said process is not complete, but it is still not the
                                recommended procedure.</p>

                        <p>The response mode determines how the AS would behave during the user logout process. There
                                are two main flows, which are described below:</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li><strong>fast</strong>: With the objective of speeding up the session closing
                                        process, the SP can decide not to wait for the IDP's confirmation, it would
                                        entrust this process only to the AS who would be in charge of carrying out the
                                        communication with the IDP in the background to ensure the closing of the
                                        session in the external IDP.

                                        <p>If the <strong><em>response_mode</em></strong> property is not specified, it
                                                will take the value <em>"fast"</em> by default. Usually this option is
                                                combined with the <strong><em>response_type</em></strong> in the
                                                <em>"body"</em> but it is not mandatory.

                                <li><strong>slow</strong>: As opposed to the <strong>fast</strong> option, this tells
                                        the AS that logout confirmation from the external IDP is required.

                                        <p> In this case you must specify the property known as
                                                <strong><em>response_mode</em></strong>
                                                with value <em>"slow"</em>. Usually this option is combined with the
                                                <strong><em>response_type</em></strong> in the <em>"redirect"</em> but
                                                it is
                                                not mandatory.

                        is recommended to perform the token revocation using the <strong>HTTP POST or DELETE</strong>
                        method.</p>

                <p>In case the <strong><em>"response_type=redirect&response_mode=slow"</em> </strong> options are used,
