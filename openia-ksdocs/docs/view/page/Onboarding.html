        <ul>
            <li><strong>Request the IDP <a href="{{url.page}}/Domain#idp_url_metadata">metadata</a></strong>.

                Typically, this metadata is distributed through a public URL that exposes the content of
                the metadata. Sometimes companies do not have a public service for this and they send a
                file with its content. Note that the SAML metadata standard belongs to the family of
                XML-based standards known as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). A SAML metadata
                document describes a SAML implementation, such as a SAML identity provider or SAML
                service provider. Implementations share metadata to establish a foundation of
                trust and interoperability.

                For a better understanding of this topic, see the topics related to how to <a
                    href="{{url.page}}/Domain#domain_new"> create </a> or <a
                    href="{{url.page}}/Domain#domain_update"> update </a> an
                authentication domain.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Request the <a href="{{url.page}}/Introduction#IDP">IDP</a> <a
                        href="{{url.page}}/Domain#idp_attr_map">attribute
                        mapping</a></strong> (OPTIONAL). At
                this point we need to define the existing relationship of the data we receive from the
                external IDP once a user completes the login process. The AS should be able to interpret
                such information from the IDP, but not all IDPs send user data using the same
                properties. </li>
            <li><strong>Request the <a href="{{url.page}}/Introduction#IDP">IDP</a> <a
                        href="{{url.page}}/Domain#idp_role_map">role
                        mapping</a></strong>
                (OPTIONAL). In some cases, extra configurations are required, including when defining
                attribute mapping
                so that the AS is able to process the profile data of an external user. Such is the case
                of roles, sometimes it is not enough to define the attribute that set profile role or
                user rights. It is
                also necessary to define the coincidence of the value contained in said property in
                order to figure out they correct coincide with the roles defined in MyCom.</li>
            <li><strong>Request an environment</strong> in the external <a
                    href="{{url.page}}/Introduction#IDP">IDP</a>
                for MyCom <strong>with at least 2 users for</strong> the purpose of
                compatibility and functionality <strong>testing</strong>. Keep in mind that each company
                has its particularities and although this solution is based on standards, this implies
                many configuration elements that define one behavior or another; not all system and
                service administrators have to use the same model. In these cases it is important to
                have a testing environment to validate the integration and in case an issue is detected,
                it can be properly tested once corrected. Even for those companies that have had a
                successful integration in the past, it would be beneficial to have their test
                environment to verify compatibility so that new developments do not affect previously
                validated functionalities or configurations.</li>
            <li><strong>Create the required MyCom resources:</strong> profiles, <a
                    href="{{url.page}}/Introduction#Credential">credentials</a> and <a
                    href="{{url.page}}/Introduction#Domain">domains</a>. We can manage this
                using the <a href="https://occ-dev.qa.ewas.aero/products/management/profiles">OCC
                    BackOffice</a>
                depending on the environment we require this configuration.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Provide the IDP with MyCom <a href="{{url.page}}/Introduction#AS">AS</a> <a
                        href="{{url.page}}/Domain#as_url_metadata">metadata</a></strong>
                for a given authentication domain. Once you have all the required information and all
                the MyCom resources mentioned in the previous point have been created, you should share
                the MyCom metadata for the authentication domain previously created with the IDP so that
                they can import our metadata and establish the relationship of trust that will allows
                both services to communicate properly. It is important to keep in mind that every time
                any value is changed in the domain configuration, the metadata associated with the IDP
                must be shared again so that they in turn proceed to update our data on their side. For
                example, if you check the settings for a domain, you will see something like the
                following:
                <a href="{{url.public}}/img/domian.metadata.1.jpg"><img alt="table.domain"
                        src="{{url.public}}/img/domian.metadata.1.jpg" /></a>

                And if you access the url defined in the <strong> as_url_metadata </strong> property you
                will be able to
                see the content of the metadata with an appearance similar to the following:

                <a href="{{url.public}}/img/domian.metadata.2.jpg"><img alt="table.domain"
                        src="{{url.public}}/img/domian.metadata.2.jpg" /></a>

                Keep in mind that the URL contained in the domain property called <strong>
                    as_url_metadata </strong>must
                be visible in the IDP network, otherwise it is possible to send them the content of the
                metadata and this should be enough, although the IDP cannot read the content in the url
                of the as_url_metadata is a bad signal that warns of possible connectivity problems.

        <h3 id="expiration"><a href="{{url.page}}/Onboarding#onboarding_saml">Setting the token expiration
                time:</a></h3>
        <p>There are different ways to configure the expiration time of the access token and refresh token, which are
            listed below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>IDP response:</strong> It is possible to establish a synchronization between the expiration
                dates for user access tokens from the <a
                    href="{{url.page}}/Introduction#AS">AS</a> server and the expiration
                time of the accounts of an external
                <a href="{{url.page}}/Introduction#IDP">IDP</a>. To achieve this goal, the
                IDP must include the values associated with the expiration and refresh
                properties in the user information that it delivers to the AS in each login process. The
                <strong><em>expiration</em></strong> property refers to the expiration time of the access token and the
                <strong><em>refresh</em></strong> property refers to the expiration time of the refresh token. The names
                of these properties <em>(refresh and expiration)</em> do not have to be exact, this can be managed from
                the <a href="{{url.page}}/Domain#idp_attr_map">attribute mapping</a> option.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Enterpriseâ€”Product:</strong> If the previous option is not specified, it is possible to define
                the <em>refresh</em> and <em>expiration</em> values in the config property stored in
                the <em>enterprise_products</em> table. For further understanding check the <a
                    href="{{url.page}}/Domain#enterprise_product">Enterprise-Product</a>
                section for domain configuration.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Domain:</strong> If the previous option is not specified, it is possible to define
                the <a href="{{url.page}}/Domain#refresh">refresh</a> and <a
                    href="{{url.page}}/Domain#expiration">expiration</a> values in the properties with the same
                name stored in the
                <em>domain</em> table.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Environment Variables:</strong> If the previous option is not specified, it is possible to take
                those values from server environment vars like <strong>SEC_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATION</strong> as refresh
                and <strong>SEC_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION</strong> as expiration.</li>
            <li><strong>Default:</strong> If none of the previous options have been specified, the default value is
                <strong>5 days </strong> for the access token and <strong>365 days</strong> for the refresh token.
            </li>
        </ol>
