            The Auth Server in the MyCom ecosystem serves as a vital intermediary and mediator service, implementing the
            AAA security model and tending to a microservices' architecture approach. It acts as a unified hub, ensuring
            a common language between all MyCom applications and its Backend (SP), including support for external
            security subsystems like Identity Providers (IDP), Authorization Servers (AS), and others. By leveraging
            OAuth as the main integration standard, the Auth Server efficiently handles client authentication,
            authorization, and accounting, granting secure access to protected resources. Its approach enables
            scalability, flexibility, and easy management, streamlining the integration and interaction between MyCom
            applications and various security components. Overall, the Auth Server plays a pivotal role in maintaining
            the security and seamless flow of information within the MyCom ecosystem, fostering a secure and unified
            environment for all applications involved. It is important to mention that this solution is not only for
            SAML, over time it should support different standard like: Kerberos, SASL, OIDC, OAuth, etc.

        <p id="SP"><strong>SP:</strong> Service Provider refers to a component, system, or application that offers
            services or
            resources that can be utilized by other applications or systems. It plays a crucial role in enabling
            integration between different software applications within a larger ecosystem.</p>
        <p id="IDP"><strong>IDP:</strong> Identity Provider is a critical component in software application integration,
            providing authentication services, managing user identities, enabling SSO, and establishing trust
            relationships with service providers. It plays a pivotal role in ensuring secure and seamless access to
            integrated applications while maintaining strong security measures and central control over user identities.
        </p>
        <p id="AC"><strong>AC:</strong> Accounting subsystem refers to a component that tracks and records the actions
            of users
            and resources within an application. It plays a vital role in ensuring accountability, resource management,
            and security within an application. It helps organizations understand how resources are utilized, monitor
            user behavior, and maintain a record of system activities for various operational and security purposes.</p>
        <p id="AS"><strong>AS:</strong> The Authorization Server is a crucial component responsible for handling the
            Authorization aspect of the security model. It plays a central role in granting access to protected
            resources based on the results of the authentication process.</p>
        <p id="Auditing"><strong>Auditing:</strong> This is a component responsible for collecting and recording
            detailed information
            about user activities, resource usage, and security-related events within a system. By providing
            comprehensive event logging and forensic capabilities, the auditing subsystem enhances the overall security
            posture of the system and aids in detecting and mitigating security threats.</p>
        <p id="Domain"><a href="{{url.page}}/Domain"><strong>Domain:</strong></a> This is an entity that stores all the
            relevant information related to Identity
            Providers, Authorization Servers, Service Providers, and general security values. By providing a flexible
            and configurable solution, the Domain Entity enhances the system's adaptability to handle different
            components and configurations, making it a valuable and powerful component in the implementation.</p>
        <p id="Credential"><a href="{{url.page}}/Credential"><strong>Credential:</strong></a> It is a collection of
            information that represents the identity of a client
            device or application. It contains the necessary data for client authentication and authorization during the
            OAuth 2.0 flow. The credential is crucial for securely identifying and granting access to the client on
            behalf of the user, ensuring the protection of sensitive data and resources within the system.</p>
        <p id="License"><a href="{{url.page}}/Credential#license_new"><strong>License:</strong></a> It is part of a
            client's credential. It is a combination of vital information such
            as the <a href="{{url.page}}/Credential#client_id">client_id</a>, <a
                href="{{url.page}}/Credential#client_secret">client_secret</a>, and <a
                href="{{url.page}}/Credential#metadata">metadata</a> defining the client's behavior and allowed
            services. The
            license facilitates centralized configuration and customization by the enterprise, enabling efficient
            management and control of client credentials across the system. The Authorization Manager uses the license
            to validate client behavior and ensure secure and authorized access to services and resources.</p>
