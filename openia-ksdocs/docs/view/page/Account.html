                <p>This specification defines a method for a protected resource to query an OAuth 2.0 authorization
                        server to determine the active state of an OAuth 2.0 token and to determine meta-information
                        about this token. OAuth 2.0 deployments can use this method to convey information about the
                        authorization context of the token from the authorization server to the protected
                        resource.</span></p>


                <div id="introspection">
                        <h3><a href="{{url.page}}/Account#introspection">Introspection</a> </h3>
                        <p>
                                Once an access token is obtained, it can be verified allowing data to be obtained from
                                the user who has logged in. The URL to obtain the user profile by validating the access
                                token can be obtained in the domain configuration defined by the property named <a
                                        href="{{url.page}}/Domain#as_url_profile"> as_url_profile. </a>and it must
                                be called using the <strong>GET</strong> method of the HTTP protocol.
                        </p>
                        <code-view>https://auth-dev.qa.ewas.aero/v1/oauth/profile?token=ACCESS_TOKEN </code-view>
                        <p>If an application type credential is not used or the selected domain does not require SP
                                verification, it is possible to use the authorization variable to specify the access
                                token that
                                you want to validate. In other cases, it will be necessary to
                                use the authorization property to send the client_id and client_secret in basic encoding
                                format,
                                as well as the access_token or refresh_token into the token in the token property. </p>
                        <code-view>https://auth-dev.qa.ewas.aero/v1/oauth/profile?authorization=ACCESS_TOKEN </code-view>
                        <p>Note that it is recommended to always use the authorization property of the HTTP protocol
                                header
                                section, even if it is allowed to be used as a GET variable. After the request is
                                executed, if
                                the access token is valid, you will get a response like the following:</p>

                        <p>Note that processing an expired <strong> <em>access token</em> </strong> will automatically
