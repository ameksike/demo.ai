    <section>
        <p>The alerting system for the authentication API integrates with Microsoft Teams and New Relic to provide
            real-time monitoring and notifications. It is important to mention that this section is complemented by

        </p>

        <p>When critical events occur within the authentication process, the system triggers alerts through two
            channels:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li id="msteam">
                <p><strong>Microsoft Teams Channel:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The system sends messages to a designated Microsoft Teams channel. These messages provide
                        instant visibility to the authentication team.</li>
                    <li>Alerts are structured with relevant information, such as the nature of the event and its
                        severity.</li>
                    <li>Team members can collaborate on troubleshooting and resolution directly within the Teams
                        channel.</li>
                </ul>
                <a href="{{url.public}}/img/alerts-teams.jpg"><img alt="alerts-teams"
                        src="{{url.public}}/img/alerts-teams.jpg" /></a>
                <p>Note that some of these alerts define several properties that describe them. In these examples you
                    can see the environment where the error was detected and its classification, as well as the
                    associated flow identifier so that it can be tracked from the log records, the domain name, the
                    company, and group identifier, among others. </p>
                <a href="{{url.public}}/img/alerts-teams-1.jpg"><img alt="alerts-teams"
                        src="{{url.public}}/img/alerts-teams-1.jpg" /></a>

                <p>The MS Teams group where the alerts are exposed can be specified through an environment variable
                    knows as <strong>CHANNEL_URL_OUT</strong>.</p>

            </li>
            <li id="newrelic">
                <p><strong>New Relic:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The system logs events and anomalies related to the authentication API in New Relic.</li>
                    <li>New Relic's logging platform collects, analyzes, and visualizes these logs, enabling thorough
                        monitoring and analysis.</li>
                    <li>Alerts can be configured within New Relic to automatically trigger notifications based on
                        predefined conditions, ensuring rapid response to issues.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In summary, the alerting system creates a robust safety net for the authentication API by utilizing Microsoft
            Teams for immediate team awareness and collaboration, and New Relic for in-depth monitoring and automated
            alerting. This proactive approach enhances the system's reliability and helps ensure timely response to
            potential authentication issues.</p>
