                <h4 id="authentication"><a href="{{url.page}}/Troubleshooting#flow_saml">What to do if some users
                                can't login?</a>
                </h4>
                <p>In case some users cannot login, the authentication method they are using must be verified (Basic
                        login, SAML login). Once the authentication method used has been identified, it must be checked
                        if the <a href="{{url.page}}/Domain">authentication domain</a> is correct; generally the
                        authentication domain is related to the
                        email or username. Once the domain has been identified, it should be checked if authentication
                        is failing for all users of the domain or only for a few. This can be reviewed through the <a
                                href="{{url.page}}/Logs">Logs</a>
                        and <a href="{{url.page}}/Alerts">Alerts</a> system. Sometimes authentication problems for
                        a domain are related to the incorrect
                        <a href="{{url.page}}/Domain#idp_role_map">roles assignment</a>, or <a
                                href="{{url.page}}/Domain#user_product">unauthorized access
                                to certain products</a>. If the cause of the error is
                        still not determined, you should check whether the <a
                                href="{{url.page}}/Introduction#SP">client application or SP</a> used by the user
                        connects
                        through a <a href="{{url.page}}/Introduction#License">license</a> or <a
                                href="{{url.page}}/Introduction#Credential">credential</a>. If so, the expiration
                        of said license must be verified, and it
                        should also be verified if the user or domain used is in active status. On the other hand, if
                        authentication fails for all users of a given domain and it uses SAML integration, the trust
                        relationship between the <a href="{{url.page}}/Introduction#AS">AS</a> and the <a
                                href="{{url.page}}/Introduction#AS">IDP</a> must be checked. For further

                <h4 id="howmany"><a href="{{url.page}}/FAQs#howmany">How many authentication domains can
                                we have?</a>
                </h4>
                <p>The authentication domains have a <em>One to Many</em> relationship with the enterprise entity. There
                        is
                        no limit to the number of domains allowed for a given enterprise. This only depends on the
                        implementation of the <a href="{{url.page}}/Introduction#SP">SP</a>.</a></p>

                <h4 id="mandatory"><a href="{{url.page}}/FAQs#mandatory">Is it mandatory to use licenses to
                                integrate my SP with the Auth server?</a>
                </h4>
                <p>It is not mandatory to use <a href="{{url.page}}/Introduction#License">licenses</a> to
                        integrate the
                        <a href="{{url.page}}/Introduction#SP">SP</a> with the Auth server. This is managed from
                        an attribute in the authentication domain known as <a
                                href="{{url.page}}/Domain#sp_verify">sp_verify</a>. Licenses add more
                        flexibility to the solution, allowing configurations to be managed centrally from the credential
                        entity. Licenses also add an extra layer of security to SPs. Although licenses are not
                        mandatory, it is recommended to use them or at least use an SP
                        identifier by defining <a href="{{url.page}}/Credential#client_id">client_id</a> and <a
                                href="{{url.page}}/Credential#client_secret">client_secret</a>.
                </p>


                <h4 id="verify"><a href="{{url.page}}/FAQs#verify">How can I verify my access token?</a>
                </h4>
                <p>It is a common practice that different applications or systems that use Access Token for user
                        identification try to decompress said security code to obtain valuable user information and make
                        decisions based on it. This is not recommended because it requires sharing the same secret key
                        used to encrypt the JWTs. Instead, systems must consume a service from the AS to
                        obtain information regarding a certain access token. For further understanding about this
